## Inspiration
Inspiration
We were inspired by the day to day struggles that many face going about their lives in these unsure times and thought that the best way to represent that feeling is to model the restrictions that COVID put on people's lives inside of a video game

## What it does
Spawns a bunch of coronavirus molecules and sends them in the player’s direction, who must dodge them as they come in. They leave a trail behind that the player also cannot touch, but the player can clear the trail using a disinfectant. The player must survive for as long as possible.

## How we built it
We used c++ and SFML to make it. The front end web development was built with HTML and CSS. The background illustration was drawn with ProCreate and the pixel art was made using Piskel.

## Challenges I ran into
Xavier was the only one of our team members who had ever used SFML in the past, so a lot of time and energy was spent familiarizing ourselves with the library and figuring out how to best utilize it. However, he was very helpful and did a great job sharing his knowledge and experience with the rest of us and helped point us in the right direction for many ideas. This is true for the 


## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Working on two different projects (a game and a webpage) simultaneously and delegating jobs between all of the members of the group in a way that was both productive and instructive for everyone involved.


## What I learned
We learned a lot of important skills in html and css, and also in c++, where we learned a lot about using libraries (SFML and boost). We also strengthened our team-working skills.
